**Currently:**  Hello, I am Aleksandr, a Machine Learning engineer at Meta with a deep interest in leveraging artificial intelligence to detect and prevent malicious cyber threats. The adversarial nature of this field, coupled with its significant potential to safeguard our digital society, deeply fascinates me. Through my work, I've explored various approaches of AI in cybersecurity, finding innovative ways to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

**Earlier:**  I have over a decade of experience across various domains of artificial intelligence, including classic Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. 
Before joining Meta, I led the development of a Computer Vision team at Petronas,where my team implemented innovative solutions in security surveillance and automated plant inspections, substantially enhancing operational efficiency and safety. 

**Education:**
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Indiana University, a path inspired by my early success in school mathematics olympiads. Currently, I am deepening my AI expertise through graduate courses at Stanford University in my free time, aiming to integrate the latest AI advancements into practical, impactful solutions.
